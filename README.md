# Simulation for Inverse Learning-Based Output Feedback Control

This folder contains the simulation code and data used in the manuscript  
**"Inverse Learning-based Output Feedback Control of Nonlinear Systems with Verifiable Guarantees."**

## Overview
The simulations validate the performance of the proposed controller in both:
- **Noise-free environments** (Section 5.1 of the manuscript), and
- **Noisy measurement environments** (Section 5.2 of the manuscript).

The simulations replicate Figures 1–3 of the paper, comparing:
- Output trajectories generated by PI controllers (training data).
- Output trajectories generated by the proposed inverse learning-based controller.
